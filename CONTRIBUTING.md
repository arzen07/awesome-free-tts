# Contributing to Awesome Free TTS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Awesome Free TTS as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

So all code changes happen through Pull Requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## We Use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)

So we can automatically generate the changelog, please write your commit message in the conventional format. Specially for pull requests, if you add new features, please use the `feat:` prefix and if you fix bugs, please use the `fix:` prefix.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-username/awesome-free-tts/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/awesome-free-tts/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
